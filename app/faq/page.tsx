                      <AccordionContent>
                        Our AI trading system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of market data,
                        identify patterns, and predict price movements. The system then executes trades automatically
                        based on these predictions, following risk parameters set by you. The AI continuously learns and
                        adapts to changing market conditions to improve its performance over time.
